# Open Data Journey

Dabbling with miscellaneous open data sources to find value

This repository is intended to publish analyses on open data with observations and commentary when needed. 
No specific domain is targeted, initial focus is mostly on socially useful Indian publicly available data.
This will be expanded in the future to complete analyses on other relevant open data.

Most of the analyses are completed using R, Excel and some other common tools.
