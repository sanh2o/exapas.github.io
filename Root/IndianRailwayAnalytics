INDIAN RAILWAYS ANALYTICS 
(On publicly available data)

This is an open-ended approach to highlight interesting aspects of the Indian Railways that may not be readily observable to an average end user. Indian Railways touches the fabric of almost every Indian, love it or hate it, it has always been an indispensable part of Indian history, economy and culture. 

Many changes have happened to the railways in recent years with a lot of emphasis on upgrading long neglected parts of the railways. These changes include electrification, opening up of new tracks, focus on improving freight movements which are the bread and butter of the railways economically. Despite the rapid economic growth the country is experiencing, we still remain a country with a per capita Nominal GDP of $ 2000/ annum. This means that we cannot afford to disregard the railways as it is by far the cheapest form of land-based transport. 

The current energy crisis and the need for making the economy green in present and future makes it absolutely vital that continued investment in railways be completed with a focus on projects such as Dedicated Freight corridor (DFC) which will prove to be the logistical backbone of the industrial zones of the country. A high logistics cost was one of the main bottlenecks which prevented India from competing effectively with other manufacturing behemoths despite having one of the cheapest labor costs in the world. 

This analysis is a fun but useful exercise and is intended to be read by anyone with a passing interest in Indian railways, logistics, trains etc. Feel free to use the images, visuals and other parts with citation to this website. I will link my raw data sources.
